# Bayview_School_EDA

The purpose of this analysis was to conduct an investigation on students' ethical behavior at Bayview University. Some faculty members were led to believe that cheating was becoming more prevalent among students, while other faculty members did not see it to be a problem. This analysis stems from an anonymous survey commissioned by the dean of the business school, and the corresponding findings uncover the truth behind the ethical behavior of the students.

In this analysis we looked at descriptive statistics and frequency distributions, found disparities between genders and students who had previously cheated. We created confidence intervals for the proportions of cheaters at the school for all students, male students and female students. Additionally, the analysis dove into the correlation values between the discrete variables for both men and women and compared. We then visualized them using heat maps. Lastly we conducted hypothesis tests to compare proportions of students at other universities.

This analysis was created using Python in collaboration with Jupyter Notebooks, specifically the package Pandas, to analyze and visualize trends within the dataset.
